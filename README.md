# DCIT407 Semester Project: Image Segmentation

## Project Description
This repository contains our group's semester project for DCIT407. The project explores the fundamental computer vision concept of image segmentation, specifically focusing on a comparative analysis of global and adaptive thresholding techniques. 

To evaluate these methods, we implemented four distinct algorithms using Python:
* **Global Thresholding:** Otsu's Method and the Triangle Method
* **Adaptive Thresholding:** Gaussian-weighted and Mean-calculated local neighborhoods

Leveraging OpenCV, NumPy, and Matplotlib , our provided Colab notebook breaks down the mathematical theory behind each algorithm and applies them to a diverse set of real-world sample imagesThe notebook provides side-by-side visual results and concludes with a comprehensive discussion on the strengths, limitations, and practical applications of each technique.
